# Hi, I'm Sushant Garudkar 👋

I’m a data science enthusiast blending programming, statistics, and curiosity to uncover insights. As one of the fastest-growing fields (projected ~36% job growth by 2033), data science excites me with its potential to drive smart decisions. I’m passionate about building models and applications that turn data into actionable solutions.

## 🛠️ Skills

My skill set covers core data science tools and foundations. I’m proficient in **Python** (with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn) and **SQL** for data manipulation. I also use **PySpark** for big data processing, and work with cloud platforms like **AWS** and **Google Cloud (Firebase)**. For building interactive apps, I leverage **Streamlit** and **FastAPI**, and for development/DevOps I rely on **Git/GitHub**, **Docker**, **Jenkins**, **JupyterLab**, and **Linux**. Strong foundations in linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics underpin my analytical work.
